## **PBR4AI Project**

PBR4AI represents Psychological Behavior Recognition for Artificial Intelligence.
Development of psychological behavior recognition technologies for artificial intelligence enables early detection of emotion/emotional cognition and disability/disease in infants or children through intelligent analysis of interaction-based multi-sensory (micromotion / language behavior / art psychology) data.

## **Goals**

Autism Spectrum Disorders(ASD) screening tool for AI(Artificial intelligence) technology
-	AI engine for non-verbal communication cognition in social interaction analysis
-	Analysis of verbal communication behavior and recognition of abnormal / homologous behaviors
-	Interaction / inference-based ASD early screening system of multiple sensory information

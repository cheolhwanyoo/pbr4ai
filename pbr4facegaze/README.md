# Facial 3D Gaze Estimation in PyTorch

A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of facial 3D gaze working at both the perspective camera projection model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

- Python 3.6 or 3.7 
- Pytorch > 1.6
- Python packages:
  * numpy 
  * scipy (for loading mat)
  * opencv

### Usage

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/etri/pbr4ai
cd pbr4ai/pbr4facegaze
```

2. Run examples
To test a facial 3D gaze with perspective projection model (use if intrinsic camera matrix is known)
```
python FGD_predict_gaze_test.py 
```
